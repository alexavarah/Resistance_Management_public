```ab_res``` is a dataframe of average resistance across several herbicides. I calculated average resistance twice; once using three herbicides and once using two herbicides. **"ab_res_Atl-Cyc.csv"**gives the average resistance across Atlantis and cycloxydim. I exclude fenoxaprop because including it leads to high resistance scores because Rothamsted found almost universal resistance to that active. However, this isn't necessarily because there *is* universal resistance to fenoxaprop; their findings may be in part because they could only include fields in the resistance assays for which they were able to get seeds, i.e. fields with enough surviving black-grass at maturity. Some of the more Northerly fields did not have enough black-grass to collect seeds from - perhaps because it was susceptible and so was still being controlled relatively well by herbicides.... <span style="color: blue;">So I only use average resistance to Atlantis and cycloxydim; I do not include fenoxaprop.</span>  

```cereal``` contains DEFRA data on the area of cereals grown in each English local authority. The original data is in the spreadsheet "structure-june-eng-localauthority-09jan18_2022-01-28.xlsx" in the 'data/DEFRA/' folder, and came from [gov.uk statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/structure-of-the-agricultural-industry-in-england-and-the-uk-at-june). Scroll down to the section called 'English geographical breakdowns' and click on 'local authority' to download the Excel file.  

# Clean density-resistance data
Resolve the fact that there two variations of a county name: Buckingham and Buckinghamshire. Change Buckingham to Buckinghamshire.  
```{r resolve-Buckingham}
ab_res <- ab_res %>% 
  # first change all instances of Buckinghamshire to Buckingham (otherwise, searching for Buckingham and replacing it with Buckinghamshire would also replace all the 'Buckingham's within the 'Buckinghamshire's)
  mutate(county = str_replace(county, "Buckinghamshire", "Buckingham")) %>% 
  mutate(county = str_replace(county, "Buckingham", "Buckinghamshire")) 
```

There are also some mistakes with the counties given in the data. Counties were ascertained by entering each farm's postcode into a [UK postcode checker](https://www.streetlist.co.uk/). Here are the ones that are wrong:  
* MK16_0HR = Buckinghamshire (given as Bedfordshire)  
* SG19_3BP = Cambridgeshire (given as Bedfordshire)  
* OX17_1QB = Oxfordshire (given as Northamptonshire)  
* OX17_1AS = Oxfordshire (given as Warwickshire)  
* LE12_6JD = Nottinghamshire (given as Leicestershire)  

```{r correct-counties}
ab_res <- ab_res %>% 
  mutate(county = replace(county, postcode == "MK16_0HR", "Buckinghamshire"),
         county = replace(county, postcode == "SG19_3BP", "Cambridgeshire"),
         county = replace(county, postcode == "OX17_1QB", "Oxfordshire"),
         county = replace(county, postcode == "OX17_1AS", "Oxfordshire"),
         county = replace(county, postcode == "LE12_6JD", "Nottinghamshire")) 
```

# Summary stats on counties & regions
Count the number of fields per county.
```{r fields-per-county}
ab_res %>% 
  group_by(county) %>% 
  tally()
```
  
How may fields in total in the data set?  
```{r}
ab_res %>% 
  #group_by(field) %>% 
  tally()
```
  
List of counties in the data:
```{r which-counties-are-in-data}
levels(as.factor(ab_res$county))
```
12 counties.  

Leicestershire isn't in here. The farm we thought was in Leicestershire (because it has an LE postcode) is in fact in Notts. 

# Assign regions
Eventually we want to know the proportions of each den-res state by broad geographic region, so assign each county to either *north*, *central* or *east* based on DEFRA regions. Counties in the East of England = east; counties in the West and East Midlands = central; counties containing Yorks* = north.  
```{r assign-counties-to-regions}
ab_res <- ab_res %>% 
  mutate(region = fct_recode(county, 
                             "east" = "Bedfordshire",
                             "central" = "Buckinghamshire",
                             "east" = "Cambridgeshire",
                             "north" = "East Riding of Yorkshire",
                             "central" = "Lincolnshire",
                             "east" = "Norfolk",
                             "north" = "North Yorkshire",
                             "central" = "Northamptonshire",
                             "central" = "Nottinghamshire",
                             "central" = "Oxfordshire" ,
                             "north" = "South Yorks",
                             "central" = "Warwickshire" 
                             )
         )
```

How many fields are there are per region?  
```{r fields-per-region}

# Work out den-res proportions by region
## Choose cut-offs  
First, work out what the cut-off points will be for the 'high' vs 'low' density and resistance categories.  

### **Density**
Work out the proportion of *high/very high* density states in a field and assign high density to any field with 50% or more grid squares in *high* and *very high* density states. I'm using a similar approach elsewhere in the analysis, for example where I look at the effect of scenario on the proportion of the field with high or very high densities at the end of the rotation. Rationale is that high and very high densities affect yield, whereas the other density states don't.  


### **Resistance**
Use WRAG guidelines (Figure 1, and see 'The ‘R’ system for interpreting results from herbicide-resistance screening assays in the UK'). They have developed a standard ‘R’ system, and this has been adopted by all resistance testing centres in the UK. There's a choice of which cut-off to use. Either the cut-off at 72% mortality / 28% survival between 'probably susceptible' and 'definite resistance present'; or a cut-off at 54% mortality / 46% survival which is the mid point of the RR category, separating 2* and 3* resistance.  

![](methods/Figure 1_WRAG_R rating system.png)
<font size="2">**Figure 1.** The older ‘star’ rating and newer ‘R’ rating systems used in the United Kingdom for designating different degrees of resistance based on responses to single doses of herbicides in resistance screening assays (Moss et al. 1999). **S** = susceptible; **R?** = early indications that resistance may be developing, possibly reducing herbicide performance; **RR** = resistance confirmed, probably reducing herbicide performance; **RRR** = resistance confirmed, highly likely to reduce herbicide performance.</font>  

## Assign the new H and L categories
So now assign high (H) or low (L) density (D) and resistance (R) states to each field.  
<span style="color: blue;">Set the cut-off between high and low resistance at 28% survival, using the WRAG cut-off between  'probably susceptible' and 'definite resistance present'.</span> This means that the low resistance category includes 'susceptible' (S) and 'probably susceptible' (R?) categories, and the high resistance category includes 'definite resistance present' (RR) and above. 

```{r assign-high-or-low-28}
ab_res_28 <- ab_res %>% 
  mutate(prop_hv = (h + v) / (a + l + m + h + v),
         D = if_else(prop_hv >= 0.5, 'HD', 'LD'),
         R = if_else(surv_mean > 0.28, 'HR', 'LR'),
         denres = paste(D, R, sep = "-"),
         denres = as.factor(denres)) 

levels(ab_res_28$denres)
```
Good, no HD-LR present.

Re-order levels.
```{r}
ab_res_28 <- ab_res_28 %>% 
  mutate(denres = factor(denres,
                         levels = c("LD-LR","LD-HR","HD-HR")))
```


### What are the total numbers of each density-resistance state?  

```{r total-for-each-denres-state-28, echo=FALSE}
ab_res_28 %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    `LD-LR` = length(field[denres=='LD-LR']),
    `HD-LR` = length(field[denres=='HD-LR']),
    `LD-HR` = length(field[denres=='LD-HR']),
    `HD-HR` = length(field[denres=='HD-HR'])
    )
```

## Calculate proportions of each den-res state by region
Work out the proportions of each density and resistance state for each region.  

```{r denres-by-region-28, echo=FALSE}
denres_states_by_region_28 <- ab_res_28 %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(region) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(
    LDLR = length(field[denres=='LD-LR']),
    LDHR = length(field[denres=='LD-HR']),
    HDHR = length(field[denres=='HD-HR']),
    total = length(field)
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(prop_LDLR = LDLR/total,
                prop_LDHR = LDHR/total,
                prop_HDHR = HDHR/total,
                survival_cutoff = 28)

denres_states_by_region_28
```
This shows the north and east have more fields with low resistance than the central region, which is what we expect.  

  
### What proportion of our farms are in each density-resistance state?  

```{r proportion-in-each-denres-state-28, echo=FALSE}
ab_res_28 %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(
    `LD-LR` = (length(field[denres=='LD-LR'])/length(field))*100,
    `LD-HR` = (length(field[denres=='LD-HR'])/length(field))*100,
    `HD-HR` = (length(field[denres=='HD-HR'])/length(field))*100
    )
```
  
Save data. 
```{r save-df, echo=FALSE}
write.csv(denres_states_by_region_28,"../output/denres_by_region.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

# Work out cereals area per region
Now, using the county-level crop areas from DEFRA (the ```cereals``` data frame), work out the area of cereals grown in each region. Make sure to remove Leicestershire and Berkshire from this data frame as actually we have no fields in these counties.   
```{r calculate-cereal-area-by-region}
cereal <- cereal %>% 
  filter(!my_counties %in% c("Leicestershire", "Berkshire")) %>%  
  # assign regions to this data
  mutate(region = fct_recode(my_counties, 
                             "east" = "Bedfordshire",
                             "central" = "Buckinghamshire",
                             "east" = "Cambridgeshire",
                             "north" = "East Riding of Yorkshire",
                             "central" = "Lincolnshire",
                             "east" = "Norfolk",
                             "north" = "North Yorkshire",
                             "central" = "Northamptonshire",
                             "central" = "Nottinghamshire",
                             "central" = "Oxfordshire" ,
                             "north" = "South Yorkshire",
                             "central" = "Warwickshire" 
                             )
         ) 
```
  
What's the area of cereals per region?
```{r}
cereal %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(region) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(regional_cereal_area = sum(cereals_area_2021_ha))
```


What's the area of cereals for each county?
```{r}
cereal %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(my_counties) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(county_cereal_area = sum(cereals_area_2021_ha))
```



Now work out the cereal area in each of the initial density-resistance states. To do this, add the cereal area onto the ```regional_denres``` data frame and then work out the proportional area.  

First, convert ```regional_denres``` from wide to long (just use the rows resulting from the 28% survival cut-off).
```{r wide-to-long}
# region must be a factor for this code to work (it already is)
reg_prop_DR <- denres_states_by_region_28 %>% 
  dplyr::select(-c(LDLR:total,survival_cutoff)) %>% 
  gather(initDR, propDR, prop_LDLR:prop_HDHR, factor_key = TRUE ) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(initDR = gsub('prop_', '', initDR)) # remove the string 'prop_'
```

Now join the regional cereal areas onto this.  
```{r join-and-calculate-LA-areas}
cereal_by_LA <- dplyr::inner_join(reg_prop_DR, cereal, by = "region") %>% 
  # work out cereal area by local authority for each den-res state
  dplyr::mutate(cereal_area_in_denres_state = cereals_area_2021_ha*propDR) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(region)
```

Save this file so I can use it to do the scaling-up.  
```{r}
write.csv(cereal_by_LA, 
          "../output/cerealarea_by_localauthority_and_denres_3DR_2021.csv", 
          row.names = FALSE)
```


Work out den-res areas per region.
```{r}
cereal_by_LA %>% 
  group_by(region, initDR) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(cereal_area_tot = sum(cereal_area_in_denres_state)) %>% 
  dplyr::select(region, initDR, cereal_area_tot) %>% 
  distinct(region, initDR, .keep_all = TRUE)
```
